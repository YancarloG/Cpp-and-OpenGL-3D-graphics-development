# Cpp-and-OpenGL-3D-graphics-development

## Overview
This repository contains a 3D scene created using C++ and OpenGL, demonstrating my skills in computational graphics and visualization. The project features a table scene with various objects, such as a book, an apple, a cup, and a can. The aim was to replicate a 2D reference image while ensuring efficient use of resources and a visually appealing outcome.

## Design Decisions
### How do I approach designing software?
- **New Design Skills:** Throughout this project, I developed skills in modular design and efficient resource management. By organizing my code into distinct functions, I improved readability and maintainability, making it easier to adjust individual components without affecting the overall functionality.
- **Design Process:** I followed an iterative design process, starting with basic geometric shapes and gradually refining the scene through texture application and lighting adjustments. I focused on key components of the reference image and ensured that the models reflected those elements accurately.
- **Future Applications:** The tactics I employed in this project, such as modularization and iterative refinement, will be invaluable in future software development projects. These skills will help me create scalable and maintainable applications.

### How do I approach developing programs?
- **New Development Strategies:** I utilized a combination of keyboard and mouse inputs for camera navigation, allowing for an intuitive user experience. This project also required careful attention to lighting and texture to enhance realism.
- **Iteration Factor:** Iteration played a crucial role in my development process. I continuously tested and refined the lighting settings, object placements, and camera controls to achieve the desired look and feel of the scene.
- **Evolution of Development Approach:** My approach evolved from a focus on basic object creation to a comprehensive understanding of how lighting, textures, and user interaction contribute to the overall experience. Each milestone informed the next, leading to a more polished final product.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- **Future Educational Pathway:** The skills acquired through computational graphics and visualizations will enhance my understanding of complex algorithms and data structures. This knowledge will be beneficial as I advance in my studies and tackle more challenging topics within computer science.
- **Future Professional Pathway:** Proficiency in computational graphics opens up diverse career opportunities in fields such as game development, simulation, and data visualization. The ability to create visually engaging graphics will be a valuable asset in any tech-related position.
